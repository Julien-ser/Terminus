# Cybersecurity Basics for Beginners

Welcome to the world of cybersecurity! This guide is designed for anyone new to the field, providing a starting point to understand the core concepts and why they are so important.

## What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security.

## The CIA Triad: The Core of Cybersecurity

The CIA Triad is a model designed to guide policies for information security within an organization.

*   **Confidentiality:** Ensuring that data is accessible only to authorized users. Think of it as privacy.
*   **Integrity:** Maintaining the consistency, accuracy, and trustworthiness of data over its entire lifecycle. This means data cannot be modified in an unauthorized or undetected manner.
*   **Availability:** Ensuring that data is available when needed by authorized users.

## Common Cyber Threats

Here are some of the most common threats you'll encounter:

*   **Malware:** Malicious software designed to harm or exploit any programmable device, service, or network. This includes:
    *   **Viruses:** A contagious piece of code that infects other software on the host system and spreads once it is run.
    *   **Ransomware:** A type of malware that encrypts a user's data and then demands a ransom to restore access.
    *   **Spyware:** Malware that secretly observes the user's activities on the computer and sends that data to a remote user.
*   **Phishing:** A type of social engineering where an attacker sends a fraudulent message designed to trick a human victim into revealing sensitive information.
*   **Social Engineering:** The art of manipulating people so they give up confidential information.
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attack:** An attack meant to shut down a machine or network, making it inaccessible to its intended users.

## Basic Security Best Practices

You can take several simple steps to protect yourself and your organization:

*   **Use Strong, Unique Passwords:** Combine letters, numbers, and symbols. Don't reuse passwords across different sites.
*   **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** This adds a second layer of security, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.
*   **Keep Software Updated:** Software updates often contain patches for security vulnerabilities.
*   **Be Wary of Suspicious Emails and Links:** Don't click on links or download attachments from unknown or untrusted sources.
*   **Back Up Your Data:** Regularly back up your important files to an external drive or cloud service.
