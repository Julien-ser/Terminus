# Intermediate Cybersecurity Concepts

This guide is for those who have a grasp of the basics and are ready to explore more complex topics and tools. We'll move from the "what" to the "how" of cybersecurity.

## The MITRE ATT&CK Framework

The [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) framework is a globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. It's used by security professionals to understand and classify attacker behaviors and to develop better defensive strategies.

The framework is divided into tactics, which represent the "why" of an attack, and techniques, which represent the "how" an attacker achieves their goals.

## Vulnerability Management

Vulnerability management is the ongoing process of identifying, assessing, reporting on, and remediating security vulnerabilities in systems and the software that runs on them.

The vulnerability management lifecycle includes:

1.  **Discover:** Scan your network to identify all assets.
2.  **Prioritize:** Assess the risks of each vulnerability and prioritize them based on severity and potential impact.
3.  **Remediate:** Patch or otherwise fix the vulnerabilities.
4.  **Verify:** Confirm that the vulnerabilities have been successfully remediated.

## Network Security

Network security is the practice of preventing and protecting against unauthorized intrusion into corporate networks.

Key concepts include:

*   **Firewalls:** A network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and decides whether to allow or block specific traffic based on a defined set of security rules.
*   **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS):**
    *   An **IDS** is a device or software application that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy violations.
    *   An **IPS** is a network security/threat prevention technology that examines network traffic flows to detect and prevent vulnerability exploits.
*   **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs):** A VPN extends a private network across a public network and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network.

## Application Security (AppSec)

Application security is the process of developing, adding, and testing security features within applications to prevent security vulnerabilities against threats such as unauthorized access and modification.

A key resource here is the **OWASP Top 10**, a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications.
