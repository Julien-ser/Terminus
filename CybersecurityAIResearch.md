# Cybersecurity AI Research

This document outlines the research and planning for creating a fine-tuned small language model (SLM) for cybersecurity tasks.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a terminal-based AI agent for cybersecurity. This agent will be powered by a small language model fine-tuned on cybersecurity-specific data. This approach aims to provide a specialized and efficient tool for various cybersecurity tasks.

## Models for Fine-Tuning

Several small language models (SLMs) are suitable for fine-tuning. These models offer a good balance of performance, efficiency, and accessibility.

### Recommended Models

*   **Llama 3.1 (8B):** A good starting point for beginners, especially the instruct versions.
*   **Phi-3-mini:** Good performance and manageable size.
*   **Mistral:** Open-source models that are frequently mentioned as suitable for fine-tuning.
*   **Gemma:** Google's family of models, including Gemma 3 270M, Gemma 3 4B, and Gemma 7B.
*   **TinyLlama:** Effective for tasks like sentiment analysis and can be fine-tuned on a single GPU.

### Fine-Tuning Techniques

*   **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT):** Techniques like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and QLoRA are highly recommended. QLoRA, in particular, combines LoRA with 4-bit quantization, allowing for efficient fine-tuning even with minimal resources.

## Data for Fine-Tuning

The quality of the data used for fine-tuning is crucial for the model's performance.

### CTF Data

Using Capture The Flag (CTF) data is a promising approach for training a cybersecurity-focused language model.

**Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced Code Understanding and Generation:** CTF challenges involve analyzing, debugging, and writing code.
*   **Vulnerability Detection and Exploitation Knowledge:** CTFs are focused on identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities.
*   **Improved Problem-Solving and Reasoning:** CTFs are complex puzzles that require logical deduction.
*   **Domain-Specific Cybersecurity Knowledge:** CTF data exposes the model to a rich vocabulary of cybersecurity terms, tools, and techniques.

**Challenges:**

*   **Data Quality and Annotation:** CTF data is diverse and can be difficult to curate and annotate.
*   **Ethical Concerns and Misuse:** Training models on exploit code raises ethical concerns.
*   **Complexity and Diversity of Challenges:** CTFs cover a vast array of topics and difficulty levels.

### Other Data Sources

*   **Threat Intelligence Feeds:** Data from threat intelligence platforms.
*   **Malware Analysis Reports:** Reports on malware behavior and characteristics.
*   **Vulnerability Databases:** Data from CVEs and other vulnerability databases.
*   **Security Logs:** Anonymized security logs from various sources.
*   **Cybersecurity Publications:** Research papers, articles, and blog posts.

## Getting Started

1.  **Select a Model:** Choose a small language model from the recommended list. Llama 3.1 (8B) or Phi-3-mini are good starting points.
2.  **Curate a Dataset:** Start by collecting and curating a dataset of CTF challenges and write-ups. Look for platforms like CTFtime and GitHub for publicly available data.
3.  **Set up a Fine-Tuning Environment:** Use a platform like Google Colab or Kaggle for free access to GPUs.
4.  **Fine-Tune the Model:** Use a PEFT technique like QLoRA to fine-tune the selected model on the curated dataset.
5.  **Evaluate the Model:** Evaluate the model's performance on a set of cybersecurity-related tasks.
