# Red and Blue Team Skills

This document provides a summary of essential skills for both Red and Blue teams in cybersecurity, with references to the Not The Hidden Wiki (NTHW) repository for further learning.

## Red Team Skills (Offensive Security)

Red teams simulate attacks to identify vulnerabilities. Key skills include:

*   **Penetration Testing:** Proficiency in testing networks, web applications, and mobile applications to find and exploit vulnerabilities. The NTHW repository has extensive resources in the `Red Team/Web Hacking` and `Red Team/Mobile` sections.
*   **Social Engineering:** The ability to manipulate individuals to gain unauthorized access. This includes phishing, smishing, and other tactics.
*   **Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering:** Understanding how to analyze and reverse engineer malware to understand its functionality and exploit vulnerabilities. The `Red Team/Malware` and `Blue Team/Reverse Engineering` sections in the NTHW repository are relevant here.
*   **Evasion Techniques:** Bypassing security controls like firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), and antivirus software.
*   **Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT):** Gathering information from publicly available sources to support attack simulations. The `Red Team/OSINT` section in the NTHW repository is a great starting point.
*   **Scripting and Programming:** Writing scripts and tools to automate tasks and develop custom payloads. Python and PowerShell are common languages for this.
*   **Active Directory Exploitation:** Attacking and compromising Active Directory environments. The `Red Team/Active Directory` section in the NTHW repository has a wealth of information on this topic.

### Red Team Tools

*   **Metasploit:** A popular penetration testing framework.
*   **Burp Suite:** A suite of tools for web application security testing.
*   **Nmap:** A network scanner for discovering hosts and services.
*   **Wireshark:** A network protocol analyzer.
*   **John the Ripper:** A password cracking tool.

## Blue Team Skills (Defensive Security)

Blue teams defend against attacks and protect an organization's assets. Key skills include:

*   **Incident Response:** Responding to security incidents in a timely and effective manner. The `Blue Team/Incident Response` section in the NTHW repository provides a good overview.
*   **Digital Forensics:** Collecting and analyzing digital evidence to investigate security incidents. The `Blue Team/Forensics` section has resources for this.
*   **Threat Hunting:** Proactively searching for threats and vulnerabilities in the network. The `Blue Team/Threat Hunting` section is a good place to start.
*   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Using SIEM tools to collect, analyze, and correlate security event data. Popular tools include Splunk, LogRhythm, and IBM QRadar.
*   **Vulnerability Management:** Identifying, assessing, and mitigating vulnerabilities in systems and applications. The `Blue Team/Vulnerability Management` section in the NTHW repository has more information on this.
*   **Network Security Monitoring:** Monitoring network traffic for suspicious activity and anomalies.
*   **Log Analysis:** Analyzing logs from various sources to identify security events and indicators of compromise.

### Blue Team Tools

*   **Splunk:** A popular SIEM and log management platform.
*   **Wireshark:** A network protocol analyzer.
*   **Snort:** An open-source Intrusion Detection System (IDS).
*   **Zeek (formerly Bro):** A network security monitoring platform.
*   **Volatility:** A memory forensics framework.
